# Description
The "Punkto≈ºercy" project is intended to be a prototype of an online store application with the possibility of collecting points by purchasing products and spending them on new ones. After launching the application, the user will be presented with a login screen, he will be able to log in using a previously created account, which he can set up using the registration panel or by logging in using his Google account. After passing the login procedure, he is redirected to the main panel of the application which contains such things as his name, points and a list of product offers which he can easily filter according to his needs. After clicking on one of the available offers, the user will be directed to the list of its products, where he will get information about the product, such as: its price in PLN, points, product name and description. Using the buttons, he will be able to set the selected quantity of a given product and add it to the shopping cart. 
The user will be kept informed about the number of products in his cart by a visible number next to the cart icon. In the shopping cart tab, he will be able to view the products he has selected along with their total price including delivery. The user will be able to cancel a given product by clicking on the cross icon. The shopping cart will be updated on an ongoing basis. The user will be able to pay for his/her purchases using the points he/she has collected or in cash, using the button to set the payment method. For each purchase made, the user will receive points, the so-called cashback (a certain percentage of the total amount of purchases). The user will be able to track his purchase history, which includes information about the products he purchased, the date of purchase and the payment method (purchase with points or currency). In the settings tab, the user will be able to view his or her data, including username, e-mail address, phone number or home address, and set his or her preferences, such as the application theme.
Using the buttons, he will be able to edit his data or send points to another user by specifying his e-mail and the amount of points he wants to transfer to him. The application's main panel will also include a button responsible for displaying a map on which it will be possible to see the nearest stationary points and the user's current position to determine which point is closest to his.

# Testing
The program was tested in the Andorid Studio environment, using the built-in emulator of the Pixel 6 phone in API versions 24 and 33 with Adnroid 7.0 (Nougat) and Android 13.0 (Tiramisu). The functions of the application work correctly after testing, the least testing was done in terms of different screen resolutions. The app looks correct on the resolution used by the Pixel 6 while on devices with other resolutions, such as tablets, the app may look different and not be readable.
